## Overview

This experiment will evaluate the overall design efficiency improvement when using the GDP system compared to traditional manual BOP design processes.

**Status**: Placeholder — to be added in a future update.

## Planned Metrics

- Time-to-first-design (manual vs. GDP-assisted)
- Iteration count to reach acceptable quality
- User satisfaction scores
